    "content": "<p>Car trouble can strike at the worst times\u2014on your way to work, running errands, or heading home after a long day. If your vehicle breaks down anywhere in Tulsa, don\u2019t panic. Here\u2019s a simple, step-by-step guide to keep you safe and get back on the road quickly.</p>\n\n<h2>1. Get to Safety First</h2>\n\n<p>If your car is still rolling, carefully steer it to the side of the road. Use your turn signal and avoid sudden movements. Aim for a safe spot away from traffic, like a shoulder or a lot. If you're near downtown, Guthrie Green or Cherry Street can be decent landmarks to help explain your location to help services.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Turn On Your Hazard Lights</h2>\n\n<p>Hazard lights let other drivers know you're in trouble. Turn them on right away to avoid collisions and make your vehicle more visible, especially at night or in low visibility conditions.</p>\n\n<h2>3. Stay in Your Vehicle (If Safe)</h2>\n\n<p>If you're on a busy roadway like Highway 169 or the Broken Arrow Expressway, it's safest to stay inside your vehicle with your seatbelt fastened. Only exit if you're in a safe, low-traffic area.</p>\n\n<h2>4. Call a Local Towing Service</h2>\n\n<p>This is where <strong>Miklos Towing comes in</strong>. We\u2019re a locally trusted name offering <strong>24/7 emergency towing in Tulsa</strong>.

Know What to Say When You Call</h2>\n\n<p>When calling a tow company, have this info ready:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Your exact location or nearest landmark</li>\n\n<li>Make and model of your vehicle</li>\n\n<li>Problem you're experiencing (e.g. engine failure, flat tire)</li>\n\n<li>Whether you're in a safe area</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2>6. Don\u2019t Accept Help from Strangers</h2>\n\n<p>Kindness is appreciated, but unsolicited help\u2014especially at night\u2014can be risky. Politely decline and let a professional service like Miklos handle it.</p>\n\n<h2>7. Wait in a Visible, Safe Area</h2>\n\n<p>If you exit the car, stay where other drivers can see you, preferably behind a guardrail or away from the road\u2019s edge. Avoid walking along highways.</p>\n\n<h2>Bonus: Prepare for Next Time</h2>\n\n<p>Here are a few items to keep in your car for emergencies:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Phone charger or battery bank</li>\n\n<li>Reflective triangle or road flares</li>\n\n<li>Blanket or poncho (especially in Tulsa's unpredictable weather)</li>\n\n<li>Printed card with your towing provider\u2019s info</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Why Choose Miklos Towing?</h2>\n\n<p>We\u2019re not just another tow company.
